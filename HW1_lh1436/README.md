For assignment 1 of HW1, I set up a repository gittest_lh1436, which includes a file, myfirstfile.txt. I also resolved a merge conflict. I then worked with Trang Tran Linh Dam to complete the fork portion of the assignment.

For Assignment 2, I created my PUI2016_lh1436 directory, as well as the PUI2016 environmental variable and pui2016 alias. I struggled a bit with adding these commands to the .bashrc, but was able to complete this portion with help from the teaching assistants. Below are the two relevant screenshots requested.

The teaching assistants also helped troubleshoot some initial issues I was having with pushing my HW1_lh1436 directory to github, but this too was resolved by creating a new lh1436 directory and deleting the old one.

Finally, for the extra credit, I worked with Laura Gladson. I completed through section 1 on my own. Laura Gladson worked with the TA to complete section 2, and explained to me the logic behind this code. She also helped guide me through the first plot. I completed the challenge section. I struggled with using git to do the file upload of the notebook, so uploaded it using GitHub instead.
